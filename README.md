## Project Name
**Carpark Ubi Application**

## Project Description:
Carpark Ubi Application is a prototype developed using Spring Boot REST CRUD JPA Project with Thymeleaf User interface with an intension to identify and allocate fast and slow charging port using a web user interface which is managed by RestAPI Controller.

## Features/Highlights of the CarparkUbi Application:
1. An application with web interface which has hosted on http://localhost:8081 (server port can be changed in application.properties)
2. Application developed with a requirement of 10 charging points
3. User can choose either 20 Amperes (fast charging) or 10 Amperes (slow charging) through web UI when a car connects
4.	Total input capacity of CarparkUbiApplication = 100 Amperes, so combination of inputs can be;
    a.5 cars with 20 Amperes or;
    b.10 cars with 10 Amperes or
    c.mix of both fast and slow charging cars but limited total current input to 100 Amperes.
5.	A charge point notifies the application when a car is plugged (status: available) or unplugged (status: occupied)
6.	If total capacity reaches 100 A and if a new user comes (high priority), then any of the fast-charging cars which connected earlier (low priority) will automatically assign to slow charging.
7.	The application also has feature implemented by providing a report with a current state of each charging point returning a list of charging point, status (Available or Occupied) and - if occupied â€“ the consumed current


## Technology
1.	Java 1.8

2.	SQL file for creating cp_tracker schema and tables such as chargingpoint, customers can be found in project folder. (path: src/main/resources/sql)

Additionally, all other dependencies such as sprint-boot-starter-web, sprint-boot-starter-data-jpa, sprint-boot-starter-thymeleaf, mysql-connected-java etc are defined in pom.xml

## How to Run the project
1.	Download the project from GitHub location
2.	Import as Maven project in Eclipse IDE
3.	Do all the pre-requisite validation
4.	Run as sprint boot application
5.	Start Rest Controller using http://localhost:8081 (url)
6.	Also suggest to refer user manual for user scenario
